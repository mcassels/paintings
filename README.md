# James Gordaneer paintings project

1. `etl` contains scripts for extracting painting information and uploading to the database
1. `client` contains the gallery website

# Current to-do list

* script to populate medium and substrate multi-select columns in the airtable from the medium column

* stub in the archive website pages

* barebones initial archive site:

- A “story” page walking through the decades of Jim’s work; Biography page
- Gallery pages organized on a per-decade basis. Paintings are displayed chronologically within the decade; Paintings can be searched by title as well as filtered.

* reorganize frontend pages into separate directories for adoption project and archive

* mobile-friendly version of archive layout

* Airtable API limits: go back to rust backend for airtable caching
